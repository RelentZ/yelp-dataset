When you do try and tell them about your problems the management barely listens and surely does not do anything about it. Security is a joke. Hardly ever watching their security cams and letting anyone in. Try ur best to not make this home","user_id":"YaMNPU1G2lRLC-kWJIGUsg"}

It is at a very nice location, the architecture is very nice, and the scenery is great, but the clientele are now middle-age frat-boy boat owners.  You know the type.
